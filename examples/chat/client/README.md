### Chat Client

This directory contains two nested TypeScript applications:

 - the root application is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) chat client;
 - the server directory contains an [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
   webserver that serves the client and issues JWTs.

Executing

```shell
 npm install
 npm start
```

in the root client directory will build the React client and run the webserver.
