### JWT Game Server

This project provides simple generic C++ classes to create game servers and
matchmaking servers using WebSockets and JWT authentication.

In order to create a backend for your game all you need to write is code
describing the game logic and matchmaking algorithm, the networking and
authentication is handled by the library; see examples.
